# JRLox: Javier's Rusty Lox

This is an implementation for the Lox language from the Crafting Interpreters book.
The code is almost a direct translation from the one in the book, with the difference that I'm trying to make it as rusty as I can.

The name probably doesn't makes sense, originally was going to call it `rjlox` as it was the rust version of the `jlox` interpreter.
Was planning to later create one `rclox` too, but when I created the create with `cargo new` got a typo that realized until it was too late, but given my name starts with J I thought it was a good name.
So I decided to keep the name, and keep both the java interpreter's and the C in a single repo.

The only purpose of this repo is to have fun, relearn some compiler stuff and take my rusty skills to the limit. But feel free to fork or send me PR's or comments if you find something interesting.
